0,"Eau Claire, Wi.Very nice modern clean hotel. Seems brand new. AC unit is quiet. Bed is comfy. Shower features hot water. Good WiFi.  Restaurant and bar located in the hotel if needed. Vintage vinyl LP's available to play on record players in the room. Large TV. Very little traffic noise, some noise from rowdy bar people but not horribly so. This is my second stay here so apparently I approve.",5,Mike N.
1,We mostly loved it! Record player in each room. Vinyl in the lobby you can check out. Nice decor. The only thing was that our bathroom door (sliding pocket door) would not close all the way. No way to latch or lock so it just kept sliding open. I shoved a slipper under the door to keep it shut. The gal at the front desk seemed surprised when we told her about it. There is no way no one else has complained about this. It was Room 2. Beware.,4,Lori S.
2,"Really cool and hip vibes overall. I stayed here for one short night while I was on a business trip and overall enjoyed my stay. PROS:*Great customer service from front staff*Restaurant on site *Clean room with a comfortable bed*A cool record player in every room *Snacks and spirits available in your room for purchase *Really pretty and romantic ambience CONS:*The general layout of this hotel makes me think of a budget-priced motel - I stayed on the ground floor and my room was 5 steps away from where cars were parked. My room had a window and I could see the faint lights and hear the car doors being slammed.*Being a bit picky here - but there wasn't a place in the shower for me to put my toiletries. Also, no bath mats in the bathroom.",4,Duri H.
3,"This was a nice place, however, for $200+/night, I felt it was overpriced. The room was nice but it was pretty small and my feet were BLACK after walking around in our room. Umm... this is something I would expect at a Motel 6, NOT at a nicer hotel where we are paying $200+ a night. That was gross and we had to lay towels down on the floor to walk on. I don't know, maybe I am being picky, but to me, this is not ok! Aside from that, the bed was comfy, came with a full stocked mini-fridge (also pretty pricey), and the area itself was very nice, although not a whole lot to do or go. I like being able to walk to bars/restaurants, etc. and there was a lot going on in the area, we had to drive for about 10-15 minutes to get to other places. We had 2 dogs and the hotel was located right across the street from the river which was very convenient to have a place to walk them, that part was nice. Other than that, I do not think we would stay here again as there were other hotels in the area which were way less expensive and would have met our needs just as well.",3,Julie K.
4,"Went to Eau Claire for the Chippewa Valley Gem and Mineral Show (which is a must for WI crystal lovers) and was happy to have stayed at The Oxbow. The hotel has a unique vibe which I would describe as hipster chic. Loved the rustic-y, Up North feel to it. The Eau Claire Jazz Festival was going on the weekend I visited and the hotel had a free jazz concert in The Lakely which was awesome. They also gave you buy one, get one free drink tokens for the bar, yippee!Definitely a fun atmosphere at The Oxbow!",4,Amber Z.
5,"We stayed in a King Suite last night that was supposed to sleep 3.  It is a very cool property -- cool paintings on the walls in the hallways going to the room.  Just a really cool look and feel for a very small boutique hotel.  We really liked the look and feel.  We just didn't have the best night in the hotel.  We were staying with our son that is going to UWEC in the fall.  We reserved this room since it said that it had a King Bed with a futon or pullout bed.  The King Bed was fine, the futon was SUPER uncomfortable.  He didn't sleep much at all.  He was not happy at all in the morning.  The walls are pretty thin.  So, when there was movement around us, it was loud in the room.  My wife and I were woken up a number of times.  The bathroom was odd too.  It had a sliding door, like a barn door, but it didn't really seal at all and it was less than 5 feet from the King bed.  So, anytime anyone was in the bathroom, if you were in bed, you could hear everything.  Kinda gross.  So, while this looked really cool, in practice, it just didn't really do the job.The shades in the room were just roller shades so while it was light out, it was light in the room.  I found that odd too.  Most hotels have a way to block out ALL light so that if you want to nap during the day, you can.  All in all, I doubt that we will be back.  The look and feel of the hotel are pretty awesome.  But the functionality was not so good.  And in the end, getting a good night's rest is the #1 job of a Hotel...",3,Adam M.
6,"This was an exceptional hotel downtown Eau Claire, WI.  My wife and I stopped here for the evening after a night of dog- sledding in Modiva, WI. We had such a fun time at Lakely thier bar and restuarant downstairs.  They had live UW students playing Jazz in the bar while we ate an amazing steak dinner over some great drinks.  They had an awesome beer menu and mixed drink selection.Our room was very modern and hipster-ish.  Many great features....  clean, modern, big bed, right downtown near bars and restuarants, walking distance to everything, cool record players in room.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely come back again.",5,Shayn L.
7,"Saw this place on Around the Corner with John McGivern. We thought it looked fun so we booked it for over Labor Day weekend. We stayed in a king balcony room in the Lodge, a remodeled motel. Parking lot on site is limited. There is an overflow lot across the street. It would be nice if the people staying at the hotel could have the parking spots right at the hotel instead of having to park across the street. The parking lot across the street should be for the bar, outfitters and restaurant. That would make much more sense and it would be easier for people staying there. The room was decent. It was actually clean. The showerhead unlimited hot water and the toiletries provided are high-quality. The biggest problems we had in the room were temperature control and the horrible chemical air freshener that went off every 15 minutes (gave me an instant migraine). It was super cold when we got there, then we had to turn on the heat. Then it got super hot and we had to turn on the air. We tried 1 million different settings with the heating and cooling and could not get it right. We took the battery out if the chemical air freshener and that solved that problem. The rooms can get noisy, especially with live music but it's only until 1130pm. You can get free ear plugs at the front desk. It really was not that bad. I had an air filter running the whole time so it blocked the minimal noise. The balcony is not private and that's hard to tell from the website. It really is not even a balcony at all. It's just the outside walkway with benches on it. When you stay in the lodge you enter your room from an exterior door that has the bench next to it. So that's your balcony. Online, the property looks a lot larger than it is. But the location is really good. You can walk to lots of shops, restaurants, entertainment, bars and many parks on the rivers. Also, when you stay there, you can use their bikes for free. They even have a tandem bike. No one told us this upon check-in so we missed out on using the free bikes which kind of irritated me. Would we stay here again? Probably.",4,Leigh A.
8,"The front desk and cleaning people are awesome at the Oxbow, i just can't recommend paying $110 for what you get. $30 more and you can get a more comfortable and fully functional room at the Lismore.",2,David L.
9,"I am sure it is just the timing of my stay and the fact that the hotel was picked for me, but the rooms give me a Bates Motel feel.  There is not a coffee maker, my room has a knock on the wall every 30 minutes or so, the internet is not working (I am here on a business trip) and the heat barely works.  From the outside it looks cute,  but inside becomes a different story.Update** As my stayed continued, I could hear the gentleman next door going to the bathroom, the shades in the room are not privacy, therefore had to drop towels over them so I could change and sleep without anyone being able to look in.  The toilet/shower area doesn't give enough room to change in there.",1,Shannon M.
10,"Ours stay at The Oxbow hotel overall was just average. We visited in February((it was not busy season )); overpriced during offseason. the adorable patio we were not able to use. The parking lot was full of snow which made it difficult to navigate.We were welcome and greeted graciously by the staff. The staff = 5/5 stars. We stayed in the flats - ((motel style not connected to the hotel ))- this was the worst possible situation it was so loud and the walls are paper thin. We stayed two nights. The first night the people were so loud next-door, it ruined our stay. The staff was apologetic but did not do anything to significantly help the noise issue, nor did they credit our stay. Not to mention it is right along a busy road so we heard cars in traffic all night. Bring earplugs!!! Hotel had a great vibe to it; however was unfortunate that we left our stay feeling not refreshed or relaxed.",3,Mags H.
11,"If you ever stayed at this location. Score it became Oxbow, you are in for an awesome treat!If you've never stayed here before, try it!It is a cool, comfy, homey, unique experience and it is obvious how much thought and passion went into the creation of the entire hotel. Locally sourced and refurbished materials are used throughout the entire hotel, which offers a history like no other places I've stayed. The record player in each room, and a music library offering so many LP options, was so cool. It felt like home away from home and Oxbow helped make my return to Eau Claire perfect.",5,Gustavo G.
12,Stayed at the Oxbow for a wedding and it was wonderful! The room itself was super cute and they provide really nice bath and body wash in the shower. The front desk staff were very friendly as well. The rehearsal dinner was at the restaurant and the food was really good and the bar staff made the most amazing Moscow mules. Hope to stay at this hotel in the future. The rooms are decorated cute and they had a record player that my boyfriend took full advantage of. Check them out if you are in town! The location is close to shops and scenic views w bridges.,5,Ashley H.
13,"It was my first time in the EC; and this was a great introduction to a fun city. The hotel is comprised of two parts: the main building and the flats: a separate building. I stayed in the upper level of the flats, and thought my room was eclectic and clean. Lots of cute little touches including locally sourced items in the mini bar, boutique soaps and lotions, and record players in each room. My only complaint.... after checking out, I received a bill for close to $30- for items I never took from the mini bar. I called the hotel, and the charges were quickly reversed. So quickly in fact, it had me wondering if all patrons are charged. Hmmm. But, no harm no foul. I would absolutely give them another try the next time I'm in town.",5,Rebecca S.
14,"Cute mid-century modern, trendy boutique hotel/motel. We were in town for a concert at the State Theatre/Eau Claire Performing Arts Center, and the Oxbow was a good place to stay and be able to walk to the show plus bars and restaurants.A plus was that the hotel is also dog friendly, for a $25 additional fee. As such, we stayed in one of the pet-friendly rooms in the motel portion, a queen patio room. The room was cute (if you've ever stayed at the Holiday Music Motel in Sturgeon Bay, the queen patio rooms are somewhat similar to their rooms) and well kept. Our room did have a faint musty odor, but included a desk, side chair, a record player (complete with vinyl for check out in the lobby), a fun Wisconsin-based snack bar, a mini bar, a mini fridge, hair dryer and MALIN+GOETZ toiletries. It was 17 degrees below zero while we were in town, but the hotel does have bikes available for guests at the Oxbow Outfitters, and I would have enjoyed taking advantage of this in nicer weather. They also rent canoes and kayaks. We overheard another guest ordering complimentary coffee service for their room to be delivered the next morning, and we decided to do the same. Within 15 minutes of our suggested delivery time we received french press coffee service and cream delivered to our room, hot and flavorful. Also, the hotel was offering complimentary Kickapoo Coffee in the lobby and Rishi Tea.On the evening we stayed, The Lakely restaurant in the hotel was booked for a reservation-only supper club, but we received two BOGO drink tokens at hotel check in and stopped by the bar at The Lakely later in the evening and had some very good red Zin.If I find myself in Eau Claire again for an overnight, I would stay at the Oxbow again as it was fun and reasonably priced.",4,Stephanie R.
15,"This is a quaint hotel/motel with a minimalist style that allows one to be downtown and near the river and bike paths. Those are the high points that we found (and this was our second time staying at The Oxbow). I can't say I'd recommend this place to anyone with children or any group (more than two people in their small rooms is uncomfortable). This place is for a niche population for sure.COFFEE? ""Bueller, Bueller...?"" The rooms do not have coffee machines. They have overpriced alcohol and candy, but no coffee. One can call the front desk (only on the morning of, NOT the evening before - asinine) to order a french press delivered to the room. I mean, I get it, in theory this is a nice option, but logistically this falls apart pretty quickly. Both times we stayed it took over 25 minutes to have coffee after waking up. If you want to be able to get up shower and have coffee right away this hotel totally fails. The bathroom set up makes everyone uncomfortable. Again, I get the thought behind having the sink separate from the bathroom and the bathroom in the bedroom, but for people trying to get ready and navigate the small room it is a real pain. I will say the toiletries are high end and smell great.The record player and album rental are fun. No free breakfast. Limited free parking on site.The beds are comfortable.The staff is pleasant but, not in any particular hurry most of the time.Overpriced for what you receive from this hotel/motel.I don't know if we will stay there again, but it might be perfect for a couple in their early twenties looking for a night out downtown and a place to crash that's not a hotel chain.",3,Corey T.
16,"Talk about a diamond in the rough.(FYI: Price isn't taken into account here since it was a business trip, but I think prices are reasonable for what you get.)The room: Unique interior design and each room has a record player. Guests can go down to the main office to rent out records (free). They have a good selection. Nice locally-made soaps are provided in the bathroom, so no worries if you don't bring your own. Clean and comfortable.When you check in, you get a drink token to use at the bar in the main building. They serve excellent craft cocktails and also have beers and wines. Their happy hour is incredible too (from what I remember).Really laid back atmosphere with nightly performances near the bar. We were there on a Tuesday, which was jazz night. Like everyone else is saying, the place is hip and modern. I'd go out of my way to stay here again. Eau Claire is definitely an up-and-coming city in WI, with the Oxbow setting the tone.",5,Nolan S.
17,"We were up in Northern WI for a small business trip and just randomly decided to stop in Eu Claire WI to stay and have dinner at this little hotel that we did not research.I had no idea but this is Bon Iver's hometown and this very cool little hotel we're staying at has record players in every room (yep for vinyls) and Bon Iver's newest album is the record they put in each room by default. So now I'm chilling here listening to Bon Iver on vinyl as I'm writing this feeling pretty fking awesome after a great dinner.So glad we chose this hotel; the rooms are cozy and swanky, the restaurant had delicious food and live jazz music, the reception area is very well designed with lots of wood accents - barnyard doors - reclaimed wood coffee table and there is a small but beautiful art gallery w/ seating, complimentary coffee and tea, very friendly staff [WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?].I could be completely wrong but I feel like the owner(s) / designer(s) of this hotel really put a lot of thought into the overall appeal. My guess would be they just simply wanted to charm their guests. It really feels like a hotel that cares about their hotel and how people feel during their stay and after their stay. Cool tidbits about the rooms;  random lamps, especially the small desktop type lamp that illuminates the record player, barnyard door for the bathroom, ample size shower and split living room and sleeping area.Based on the price and the low expectations I had, this is easily one of my favorite hotels in WI and Chicagoland.",5,Ron B.
18,"My husband and I stayed here during the Eaux Claires music festival. The hotel has a really cool vibe and is in an area of the city that is being developed like crazy so it's definitely setting some trends for area businesses to live up to.It was a monstrously busy weekend for the hotel with all of the events surrounding the festival and almost everything went smoothly and we felt well taken care of. We did have a couple hiccups with our stay, but I could tell it was not common in the way that management handled things. Allison was super attentive to our issues and went out of her way to make it right. We would definitely recommend staying at The Oxbow and plan to do so again the next time we find ourselves in North Western WI. If you stay here, make it a point to check out the activities they offer in the area through Oxbow Outfitters, the fancy ass cocktails at The Lakley (attached restaurant), the record selection in the front lobby (3 free rentals a night), and make sure you ask the friendly and knowledgeable staff for recommendations on everything awesome to do in Eau Claire. You can tell that folks in EC love their town and they want you to love it too.",4,Melissa S.
19,"When you see the phrase ""hotel restaurant"" as part of a restaurant review, it is almost always in the context of something like, ""... but it's not bad for a hotel restaurant."" Hotel restaurants bring to mind prepackaged food sold at an exorbitant mark up because the owners know they have a captive audience. You know, the kind of place that serves fast-food quality hamburgers for $15. So when we heard that The Oxbow was going to have its own restaurant, we quietly hoped that they would not become another example of the ""hotel restaurant"" stereotype.The Lakely, the new restaurant in the Oxbow, clearly throws that stereotype out the window. Helmed by renowned local chef Nathan Berg, The Lakely offers an innovative yet compact menu that should satisfy the needs of any diner in the Chippewa Valley. We decided, being the adventurous eaters that we are, that we would visit The Lakely on opening night. Obviously, the first night a restaurant is open is always an adventure, but we were remarkably surprised at how smoothly the service went over the course of the evening. Jimmy, our server, did an excellent job of making sure that the pace of our meal perfect, and his attentiveness to our table should be commended. We were also impressed with the speed of the bar service under lead bartender Jorja. Our beverages were promptly refilled despite the complexities of some of the cocktails on the menu.As a group, we sampled virtually the entire menu and we were, to say the least, impressed. While we could wax poetic about essentially everything we ordered, four menu items truly stood out. On the starter list, the roasted squash soup had an amazingly smooth texture and intensely rich flavor. Another starter of note was Berg's take on traditional Canadian comfort food, poutine. The substitution of thinly sliced potatoes for fries and the savory mushroom gravy turned this appetizer into a clear winner. Among the main courses, the clear consensus of the group was that the Hot Dish Au Canard was one we would definitely order again. The perfectly cooked duck combined with wilted greens, wild rice, and sarvecchio cream sauce was a wonderful, savory feature on the menu. Another star on the menu was the Wild Rice Kofta, an outstanding vegetarian option with a spiced tomato cranberry sauce. The Kofta was an eye-opening revelation, and proof that not all restaurants in Eau Claire force vegetarians to eat piles of steamed vegetables. Finally, we would be remiss if we did not mention the cocktail menu at The Lakely. Under the creative direction of lead bartender Jorja, there are several innovative beverages on the menu worthy of your attention. Two that stood out for us were the gin-based Corpse Reviver and the Maple Bourbon Sour, both of which became fast favorites among the group. The clear consensus of the group was that The Lakely was offering a menu that is truly unique in the Chippewa Valley. Nathan Berg's innovative food and his commitment to local producers, combined with a fun and creative cocktail menu, as instantly turned The Lakely into one of our go-to spots.---Geoffrey D.

20,"Nicely appointed boutique hotel. We stayed two nights the staff was very helpful and friendly. They have a great outdoor patio with fireplaces. Amazing craft cocktails and food. We'd definitely stay there again if we were in the area.  Few minor things that would prevent this from being a five ...lack of counterspace for toiletries, aside from natural light there's not a whole lot of light to put on make up or get ready to go out and also some pretty interesting parking if you do not park in the flat lot.  For a few nights it was no big deal. Completely enjoyed our stay.",4,Laura Z.
21,"First time staying at the Oxbow.  I loved the atmosphere and the location.  We were able to walk to our favorite places.  (Fyi for the best burgers ever, walk to the Amber Inn).  First and foremost, the customer service and staff are probably the nicest and most accommodating I've experienced.  I give the staff 5 stars.  I'd stay at the Oxbow for that reason alone.  I have a couple of gripes but they're not reasons to not stay there again.  Here are the compliments.  We stayed in the suite.  It was very spacious which was great.  The bed was comfortable and I appreciated the large TV in the bedroom.  The ""living area"" was convenient because we had a couple friends over to watch the Badger game.  We had a great view of Eau Claire.Now some of the slight annoyances.  There were no hooks or holders for towels.  The vanity was small so we really couldn't lay our hand towels on there.  Please put a couple of hooks near the vanity.  The door to the bathroom was a rolling barn door.  It fit the decor but it's not really functional.  Now, I was there with my husband so neither of us cared about sounds.  Just be advised that the door doesn't give one privacy.  But maybe millennials are above that and good for them if they are.  Overall, it was fun and an enjoyable experience.  I'd stay there over other ""typical"" motels around Eau Claire.",4,Sara T.
22,"Wow! Really cool place and AWESOME staff! Tristin, Hannah, Shania, and CV were the best!!! I didn't get the bar staff names, but they were excellent too! The room was super clean and fresh, even had a record player too! The bar was right next to check in and had a cool group singing away! Great selection of IPA's and since I got there late they only had meat and cheese platters that were really tasty and perfect! Was not expecting this and way better than staying at the Hampton Inn!! LOL Keep up the great work! See you next time!",5,Tom D.
23,"We spent two nights at the Oxbow in a King Balcony room. The room was average in size, but the decor is a cool Wisconsin retro look right down to the record player your room. The bed was perfect and the room very comfortable. Really helpful and friendly staff, great coffee in the lobby every morning and, amazingly, they had bikes we could take out onto the Chippewa River trail which is just two blocks from the hotel. We also so had dinner at their restaurant, The Lakely, and even though we arrived 30 minutes before they were done serving our waiter was a pro and didn't rush us. Great food! This is a real gem of a place to stay, can't wait to come back.",5,Sara S.
24,Crappy hotel. Overpriced. Hot water ran out half way through my shower. Sink would not hold water. Dirty hotel.  Looks like the white tile in the bathroom hasn't been washed since last year.  There are better options in Eau Claire.,1,Russ H.
25,This hotel really needs updated. The room smelled like mildew and floors were dirty.  The restaurant food was marginal. There are better hotels in the area.,1,Denise H.
26,"Wow, what a delightful surprise! A trendy renovation of an old building, coupled with music, art and a delicious breakfast (smoked trout omelette with spinach and chèvre!). I will be back here for sure!",5,Carrie B.
27,"We stayed here for a girls getaway and I cannot say enough fabulous things about this place! From the desk staff (hi Kayla and Daniel!) to the bar staff (hi Logan!), it was TOP NOTCH!  We felt appreciated by everyone that worked there, the vibe is incredible, the food was great and the drinks?!  Swoon worthy! Staff had awesome recommendations for us for eating, dining, exploring, dancing, karaoking (is that a word?!) and now I keep telling all of my friends about it. Who knew it would be so awesome?! Can't wait to go back!",5,Annie L.
28,"The staff was extremely nice, and the place is better than advertised. For the same price as a chain, why wouldn't you stay somewhere like this?",5,Joe O.
29,"I stayed here in March for a winter weekend for a gals get-away.  It had many bonuses. Location was close to shops and theater.  The path to the river walk is just across the street.  The food in the restaurant was wonderful for both breakfast and dinner.  Because it was winter and still cold, it was perfect to have the restaurant on site. They were not serving lunch, maybe because it was off season.  Excellent service from mostly college age young people.  There is an elevator and hot coffee and tea in the lobby all day.  We are 2 middle aged / older ladies and we had room 33, on the 3rd floor of the main older building above the restaurant.  It was a queen suite room with a bedroom and a sitting room.  All new and lovely.  It does work for 2 friends as they give you bedding to make up the sitting room futon couch in to a single bed.  The bedroom has no door, so it's not private.  Whoever sleeps in the sitting room has to walk into the bedroom to use the bathroom.  The sink is outside the bathroom between the 2 rooms. This worked fine for us.  We would stay there again.",4,Martha M.
30,"Great place for a weekend stay, and the food at The Lakely is superb. The menu is smaller than the norm but there is more than enough variety to satisfy anyone's taste. Start with the squash soup and you won't go wrong, and if you show up Thursday through Saturday they have live jazz on stage. And I can't say enough about the drinks too.",5,James H.
31,Fantastic minication at the Oxbow.  From the 50's deco decor to the record player in the room complete with LP lending library in the lobby. The Lakely was a great spot for a nightcap. Craft cocktails built by the best mixologists. Can't wait to come bacj,5,Debbie B.
32,"Interesting hotel in the heart of downtown Eau Claire. Attentive staff, quaint rooms and an attached restaurant with live music. Very close to UWEC. Give it a try.",4,Keith W.
33,"Cozy environment, excellent service and a generally comfortable and enjoyable experience.",5,Heather S.
34,"We celebrated my birthday weekend with a weekend trip to The Oxley and we couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more. From the free upgrade, to the beautifully designed and clean rooms, extremely comfortable bed and bedding, it truly was a wonderfully relaxing weekend! Check out The Lakely for a bite, phenomenal food!",5,Megan K.
35,"Wonderful hotel and bar. Unique, thoughtful, homey. Best sleep I've had in a hotel bed. Love the vinyl record players in every room. Staff is super friendly. Cocktails are crafted with precision, a joy to watch bartenders crating the cocktail, then me consuming the deliciousness. Live jazz music regularly in the bar is a joy. You can tell lots of thought was put into every detail of this place and the staff really care and show passion for what they're doing. Complimentary coffee is quite good as well. Stay here and/or drink here whenever you are in Eau Claire.",5,T V.
36,"We booked a couple of rooms earlier this week and had a great (first) visit to Eau Claire.  I skimmed through the other reviews and agree with most of what I read.  To these I'll only add that the place does have a good vibe, the kind that makes you smile a little with each distinctive little touch you discover.  We had one room in both parts of the hotel.  While similar, there were different furnishings in the rooms, which gave them each a distinctive feel. Yes, the staff is great, friendly and helpful - honestly invested in the service they provide.  Yes, the Lakely is a great resource. The food is interesting, locally sourced, and well prepared.  The cocktails are (indeed) tasty, and the bartender is appropriately eccentric.  There were also a couple of local regulars in the bar who were friendly and engaging. The terrace was delightful on the evening of our stay (perhaps a sun shade over a portion would be a welcome addition on a hot afternoon).  We are headed back to Eau Claire in the fall, and will definitely book another night or two at the Oxbow Hotel.",5,Chris R.
